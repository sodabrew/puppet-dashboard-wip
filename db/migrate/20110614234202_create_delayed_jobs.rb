========================================================================
You MUST run at least one `delayed_job` worker on your system, so that
background jobs are processed.  Without this various parts of dashboard,
especially things like report import, will not work.

Please see `README.markdown` for details of how to run the workers, or
use one of:

] rake RAILS_ENV=production jobs:work
] ./script/delayed_job -p dashboard -n $CPUS -m start
